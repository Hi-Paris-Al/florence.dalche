In this work we proposed Infinite Task Learning, a novel nonparametric framework
aiming at jointly solving parametrized tasks for a continuum of
hyperparameters.
% The approach relies on \ac{vv-RKHS}, in specific cases it recovers several
% existing multi-task approaches and extends Parametric-Task Learning to nonparametric models and a
% larger class of loss functions.
We provided
excess risk guarantees for the studied ITL scheme, and
demonstrated its practical efficiency and flexibility in various
tasks including cost-sensitive classification, quantile regression and density
     level set estimation.
% Future works should
%  study whether local properties of the algorithm ($\theta$-property in \ac{OCSVM},
%  quantile property in \ac{QR}) are asymptotically kept true for all hyperparameter values,
% as well as investigate acceleration schemes based on kernel approximations.
%
%  especially the ones outside the locations taken in the approximation of the
% integral.
% % %
% Another topic of interest concerns the exploration of other parametrized
% tasks, including ones with more complex or higher dimensional hyperparameter
% spaces.
